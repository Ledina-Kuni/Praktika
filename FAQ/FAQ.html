        <div class="questions-container">
            <div class="question">
                <button id="b1">
                    <span>Tell me about yourself</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>This is one of the first questions you are likely to be asked. Be prepared to talk about yourself, and why you're an ideal candidate for the position.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="question">
                <button id="b2">
                    <span>What interests you about this role?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>Like the previous question, hiring managers often include this question to make sure you understand the role and to give you the opportunity to highlight your relevant skills. In addition to thoroughly reading the job description, it can be helpful to compare the role requirements against your skills and experience. </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="question">
                <button id="b3">
                    <span>Why do you want this job?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>This interview question gives you the chance to discuss all you know about the job and the company, and why you are a good match for them. Do your research - the interviewer is listening for an answer that indicates you've given this some thought. </p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="question">
                <button id="b4">
                    <span>Do you have any questions?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
                </button>
                <p>This is usually the last question in an interview and it's your chance to show how interested you are in the job. Research the company beforehand, especially through its website, and always have two questions ready that are connected to what they do. This shows you've taken the time to research. It also shows you're keen and prepared. You can even ask about the next steps in the hiring process.</p>
